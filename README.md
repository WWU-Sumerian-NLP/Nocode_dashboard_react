# Nocode_dashboard_react

To allow use of our tooling, we built out an intuitive dashboard which lets users view, modify and upload their data 

## Description

For now, we have tabs for entity extraction, relation extraction, and neo4j relationships. Very soon, we will allow users the ability to access their own sumerian tablets and a host of other downstream tasks.

This dashboard is designed to be easily extendable. Supporting a new tab for a service requires a few easy steps
1. Create a new form in our frontend
2. Add an entry in our servers database 
3. Create an endpoint in our backend that uses the service
